STARFiSh: 
is a shell-based scientific simulation program for blood flow in mamals!

vascular network creator - vnc - is a shell-based tool to create 
arterial networks for the simuation tool STARFiSh.

For programmers going to work on this code:

The standard convention for writing Python code:
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

Using Sphinx with some extensions, docstrings in the code 
will be used to autogenerate documentation. To generate it, 
enter the AutoDocumentation folder and run "make html". If 
you've altered modules, run "make clean" first. If you've 
altered module names, folders, or top level modules, edit 
AutoDocumentation/sources/index.rst accordingly, and then 
run "make fullupdate".

We will use a slightly modified Google standard 
for writing docstrings. (return is different)

def foo(input1, input2):
	"""
	describe function here
	
	Args:
		input1 (type): description of input1
		input2 (type): description of input2
	
	Returns:   ### This has different syntax depending ###
               ### on how many outputs it has.         ###

        type of soleOutput: description of soleOutput

		type of output1
			description of output1
		type of output2
			description of output2
	
	Raises:
		IOError: An error occured loading myClass.myStuff
	"""

Example can be found in UtilityLib/moduleCSV.py
in the function readBCFromCSV
